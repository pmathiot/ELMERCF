# ANT50.GL1

## Configuration Description

## Simulations

### ANT50.GL1-EPM007
- The ice shelf melt comes from the NEMO eORCA025.L121-OPM021 simulation over period 1985-1995 drowned and masked by the initial grounding mask (mask constant in time) with melt up to the initial GL. 
### ANT50.GL1-EPM008
- The ice shelf melt comes from the NEMO eORCA025.L121-OPM021 simulation over period 1985-1995 (no specific mask applied, ie closed to NEMO mask)
### ANT50.GL1-EPM009
- The ice shelf melt comes from the NEMO eORCA025.L121-OPM021 simulation over period 1985-1995 drowned and masked at every time step by the current grounded mask (no melt at GL)
### ANT50.GL1-EPM010
- The ice shelf melt comes from the NEMO eORCA025.L121-OPM021 simulation over period 1985-1995 drowned and masked at every time step by the current grounded mask (melt at GL)
### ANT50.GL1-EPM011
- The ice shelf melt comes from the NEMO eORCA025.L121-OPM021 simulation over period 1985-1995 drowned and masked by the initial grounding mask (mask constant in time) without melt at GL.
